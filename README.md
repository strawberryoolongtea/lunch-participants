# List of lunch participants

I'm on duty for lunch. I have to change the list of lunch participants every week.

* Lunchtime is divided into first and second.
* Primary and secondary participants are divided equally or have one person difference.
* Some participants have lunch at a fixed time.
* Participants in the sales department should be divided into first and second.

Outputs a monthly list if an array of participant names is specified.
