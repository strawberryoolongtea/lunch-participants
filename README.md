# Lunch participants list

I'm on duty for lunch. I have to change the lunch participants list every week.

* Lunchtime divides into the first and second times.
* First-time and second-time participants are equally divided or one is different.
* Some participants have lunch at a fixed time.
* Sales participants must be divided into the first and second times half.

If an array of participants' names is specified, outputs a monthly list.
