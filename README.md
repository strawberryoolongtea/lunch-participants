# List of lunch participants

I'm on duty for lunch. I have to change the list of lunch participants every week.

* Lunchtime is divided into first and second.
* Participants counts are divided randomly.
* Participants counts are divided equally or have one person difference.
* Participants counts in the sales department are divided equally or have one person difference.
* Some participants have lunch at a fixed time.

Outputs a monthly list if an array of participant names is specified.
